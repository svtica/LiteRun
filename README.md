```cmd
LiteRun.exe -server COMPUTER -command "dir C:\"
```

### With Credentials
```cmd
LiteRun.exe -server COMPUTER -user DOMAIN\username -password PASSWORD -command "ipconfig /all"
```

### Running Applications
```cmd
LiteRun.exe -server COMPUTER -exec "C:\Program Files\App\app.exe" -args "/silent"
```

### Interactive Session
```cmd
LiteRun.exe -server COMPUTER -interactive
```

## Command Line Options

```
LiteRun.exe [options]
  -server <hostname>     Target computer name or IP address
  -command <cmd>         Command to execute
  -exec <path>           Executable file to run
  -args <arguments>      Arguments for executable
  -user <username>       Authentication username
  -password <password>   Authentication password
  -timeout <seconds>     Operation timeout (default: 30)
  -interactive           Start interactive session
  -verbose               Enable verbose output
  -log <file>            Log output to file
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `LITERUN_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`: Default timeout for operations
- `LITERUN_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity level
- `LITERUN_CONFIG_PATH`: Path to configuration file

### Configuration File
Create `literun.config` in the application directory for default settings:
```ini
[DEFAULT]
Timeout=60
LogLevel=INFO
RetryCount=3
```

## Technology Stack

- **Platform**: Windows (Native C++)
- **Networking**: Windows Networking APIs, WinRM
- **Security**: Windows Security APIs, SSPI
- **Communication**: Named Pipes, TCP/IP

## Development Status

This project is **Work in Progress** and **not actively developed**. Core functionality is operational but some advanced features may be incomplete. Moderate contributions are accepted for improvements and bug fixes.

## System Requirements

- Windows 7 or later (both local and remote)
- Network connectivity to target systems
- Appropriate permissions on remote systems
- Windows Remote Management (WinRM) enabled on targets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Connection Failed**: Check network connectivity and WinRM configuration
- **Access Denied**: Verify user permissions on remote system
- **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout value or check network latency
- **Authentication Failed**: Verify credentials and authentication method

### WinRM Configuration
On target systems, ensure WinRM is properly configured:
```cmd
winrm quickconfig
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
```

## Security Considerations

- Use appropriate authentication methods for your environment
- Consider using service accounts with minimal required privileges
- Monitor and audit remote execution activities
- Ensure network communications are properly secured
